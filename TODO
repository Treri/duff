* Change to getopt_long and add long options?
  - ...which would require adding gnulib
* Detect duplicate file arguments?
  - is that even possible?
* Detect duplicate directory subtrees?
  - ...in treeduff, not plain old duff
* Finish i18n work.

Documentation
* Add ALGORITHM section (or similar) to manpage.
  - ...although first we should have an algorithm
* Add more examples to manpage.

Optimisation
* Make sampling digest use the first n KBs
* Make directory cache less stupid and slow.
