List of things to do in duff
============================

Functionality
* Change to getopt_long and add long options?
  - which would require adding gnulib
* Detect duplicate file arguments?
  - possibly by comparing normalized paths

Documentation
* Add ALGORITHM section (or similar) to manpage
  - although first we should have an algorithm worthy of the name
* Add more examples to manpage
* Improve formatting of examples

Optimisation
* Make directory cache less stupid and slow
* Do work necessary to enable SHA*_FAST_COPY
* Do "smart stuff" to "make it go faster"
  - people use duff on millions of files; optimise for that
