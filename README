duff - Duplicate file finder
============================

0. Introduction
===============

Duff is a command-line utility for identifying duplicates in a given set of
files.  It attempts to be usably fast, and uses SHA1 checksums as a part of
the comparisons.

The project website is here:

  http://duff.sourceforge.net/

Duff resides in public CVS on cvs.sourceforge.net.  The CVSROOT for anonymous,
read-only access is:

  :pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/duff

The CVS module for duff 0.x is `duff'.

3. Frequently asked questions
=============================

Q: Hey, that is O(n^2) right?
A: Well, yes, but it's still fast enough in most cases.

   I won't even pretend to call this a benchmark, but duff running cold on a
   directory tree with 2000+ images (190MB) found the 13 duplicate clusters in
   4 seconds, and this on my ageing laptop.

Q: How does it work, then?
A: The basic idea (as of version 0.3) is:

   * Only compare files if they're of equal size.
   * Compare a few random bytes before checksumming large files.
   * Compare checksums before actual contents.
   * Don't compare actual contents unless explicitly asked.

Q: How do you calculate the checksum?
A: It is a regular SHA1 message digest, calculated using sha1-asaddi.

Q: What is it good for?
A: Getting a list of, and then usually removing, duplicates in a given set of
   files.  Some people find this ability useful. If you don't, feel free not to
   use duff.

Q: Is duff named after Tom Duff?
A: As much as I like Duff's device, no, it isn't.  Duff stands for DUplicate
   File Finder.

Q: Shouldn't duff also do `x'?
A: I don't know, but you're welcome to write a patch to make it do `x', or send
   me an email explaining why you think duff should do `x'.  If I like your
   patch or email, a future version of duff will probably do `x'.


4. Building Duff
================

If you got this source tree from a CVS repository, you will need to bootstrap
the build environment using `bootstrap.sh'.  Note that this script requires
autoconf and automake to run.

If (or once) you have a `configure' script, go ahead and run it.  No additional
magic should be required.  If it is, then that's a bug and should be reported.

This release of duff has been successfully built on the following systems:

  Debian Etch powerpc
  Debian Woody alpha
  FreeBSD 4.11 x86
  FreeBSD 5.4 x86
  SunOS 5.9 sparc64

Earlier releases have been successfully built on the following systems:

  Arch Linux x86
  Debian Etch powerpc
  Debian Woody alpha
  FreeBSD 4.11 x86
  FreeBSD 5.4 x86
  Darwin 7.9.0 powerpc
  SunOS 5.9 sparc64

However, it should build on most Unix systems without modifications.


5. Installing Duff
==================

See the file `INSTALL'.


6. Using Duff

9. Disambiguation
=================

This is duff, the Unix command-line utility, and not DUFF, the Windows program.
If you wish to find duplicate files on Windows, use DUFF.
