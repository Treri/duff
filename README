4. Building Wendy

4.0 Building on Unix-like systems
---------------------------------

If you got this source tree from a CVS repository, you will need to
bootstrap the build environment using `bootstrap.sh'.  Note that this
script requires autoconf and automake to run.

If (once) you have a configure script, go ahead and run it.  No
additional magic should be required.

Duff has been successfully built on the following Unix platforms:

  Mac OS X 10.3 powerpc
  Debian Sarge powerpc
  Ubuntu Hoary powerpc
  FreeBSD 4.11 i386

However, it should build on most Unix platforms without modifications.

4.1 Building on Windows
-----------------------

Sorry, duff has not been tested on Windows yet.
