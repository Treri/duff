duff - Duplicate file finder
============================

0. Introduction
===============

Duff is a command-line utility for identifying duplicates in a given set of
files.  It attempts to be usably fast, and uses SHA1 checksums as a part of
the comparisons.

The project website is here:

  http://duff.sourceforge.net/

Duff resides in public CVS on cvs.sourceforge.net.  The CVSROOT for anonymous,
read-only access is:

  :pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/duff

The CVS module for duff 0.x is `duff'.

The version numbering scheme for duff is as follows:

 * The first number is the major version.  This will be updated upon what the
   author considers a round of feature completion.  The only feature currently
   missing for the next major release is i18n.

 * The second number is the minor version number.  This is updated for releases
   that include minor new features, or features that do not change the
   functionality of the program.

 * The third number, if present, is the bugfix release number.  This indicates
   a release which only fixes bugs present in a previous major or minor release.

3. Building Duff
================

If you got this source tree from a CVS repository, you will need to bootstrap
the build environment using `bootstrap.sh'.  Note that this script requires
autoconf and automake to run.

If (or once) you have a `configure' script, go ahead and run it.  No additional
magic should be required.  If it is, then that's a bug and should be reported.

This release of duff has been successfully built on the following systems:

  Darwin 7.9.0 powerpc
  Debian Etch powerpc
  Debian Sarge alpha
  FreeBSD 4.11 x86
  FreeBSD 5.4 x86
  SunOS 5.9 sparc64
  Ubuntu Breezy x86

Earlier releases have been successfully built on the following systems:

  Arch Linux x86
  Darwin 7.9.0 powerpc
  Debian Etch powerpc
  Debian Sarge alpha
  FreeBSD 4.11 x86
  FreeBSD 5.4 x86
  SunOS 5.9 sparc64

However, it should build on most Unix systems without modifications.


4. Installing Duff
==================

See the file `INSTALL'.


5. Using Duff
=============

See the accompanying manpage duff(1).

To read the manpage before installation, use the following command:

  groff -mdoc -Tascii duff.1 | less -R

7. Frequently asked questions
=============================

Q: Hey, that is O(n^2) right?
A: Well, sort of.  Lots of very intelligent people keep telling me it's
   O(n log n), and present complex solutions that, when implemented, don't give
   any significant advantage in real world use.  Thus, my particular
   implementation is still O(n^2).

   I won't even pretend to call this a benchmark, but duff running cold on a
   directory tree with over 2000 images (190MB) found the 13 duplicate clusters
   in 4 seconds, and this on my ageing laptop.

Q: How does it work, then?
A: The basic idea (as of version 0.3) is:

   * Only compare files if they're of equal size.
   * Compare a few bytes before checksumming large files.
   * Compare checksums before actual contents.
   * Don't compare actual contents unless explicitly asked.

Q: How do you calculate the checksum?
A: It is a regular SHA1 message digest, calculated using sha1-asaddi.

Q: What is it good for?
A: Getting a list of, and then usually removing or joining, duplicates in a
   given set of files.  Note that duff itself never modifies any files, but it's
   designed to play nice with tools that do.

Q: Is duff named after Tom Duff?
A: As much as I like Duff's device, no, it isn't.  Duff stands for DUplicate
   File Finder.

   (No, it's not named after the beer, either.)

Q: Shouldn't duff also do `x'?
A: I don't know, but you're welcome to write a patch to make it do `x', or send
   me an email explaining why you think duff should do `x'.  If I like your
   patch or email, a future version of duff will probably do `x'.

9. Disambiguation
=================

This is duff, the Unix command-line utility, and not DUFF, the Windows program.
If you wish to find duplicate files on Windows, use DUFF.
